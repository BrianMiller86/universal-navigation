# Instructions for universal navigation

## FAQ
- **Should I register each application?** <br>
> Yes.  But if that is not practical at present, make sure that at least one application from your team is registered so that you get access to the BETA and release.

- **Do I need to register websites?**<br>
> No. Agency and Initiative content focused websites have already been catalogued and technical owners will receive the BETA automatically.

- **Will the Policy be updated?**<br>
> Yes. After the BETA feedback.

- **Who can participate in the BETA and give feedback through the Yammer group?**<br>

- **Should all applications be registered?**<br>
> Register only the applications that currently implement the "NYS Common Banner" and will need to replace it with the new "Universal Navigation"

- **What if an application cannot implement the Universal Navigation by 9/29?**<br>
> Though all applications should attempt to replace the banner by 9/29, If that is not achievable, move forward through normal deployment schedules so that the universal navigation can be implemented as soon as possible. Â All apps should have the new Universal Navigation by 10/15/2014
