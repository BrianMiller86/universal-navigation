## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this the final code, banner, and footer?
> The embed code is not yet final. 
>
> The design is finalized, but any major user experience or functional issues will be addressed before launch. If there are unresolved issues that would impact the user experience on a website, fall back to the simplified static version. After launch, issues and enhancement suggestions will be tracked and reviewed and the universal navigation will be iteratively improved. 

### Will the Policy be updated?
> Yes. After the BETA feedback improvements have been finalized and a launch date is set. (previous policy for reference http://on.ny.gov/1uXDHuI)

### How can agency leadership or press offices get more non-techical information about the universal navigation?
> If there are non-technical more strategic questions that are not answered in the FAQs, questions can be elevated through PIO channels to the [Media Services Center](http://www.ogs.ny.gov/Core/MSC/) as the Chamber is sponsoring and guiding the effort from a user/citizen experience perspective. Please also share this site with any website stakeholders.

### What if an application cannot implement the Universal Navigation by 9/29?
> Though all applications should attempt to replace the banner by 9/29, If that is not achievable, move forward through normal deployment schedules so that the universal navigation can be implemented as soon as possible.  All apps should have the new Universal Navigation by 10/15/2014

### In the Banner several links are not HTTPS which will cause a certificate error on HTTPS pages, will this be rectified?
> SSL Cert is currently in progress. All links will be HTTPS in final code.

### How will issues be tracked after launch?
